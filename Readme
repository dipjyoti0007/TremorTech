## 🚨 Problem Statement

Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder primarily affecting individuals over 60 years old.  
Globally, PD has:

- 📈 Doubled in prevalence in the last 25 years  
- 👥 Affected over **8.5 million** people as of 2019  
- 😔 Caused **5.8 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)**  
- 🧬 15% cases linked to genetics, others to environmental toxins  

🌀 **Symptoms include:**
- 🤲 Tremors in limbs or jaw  
- 🪵 Muscle stiffness  
- 🐢 Slowness in movement  
- ⚖️ Impaired balance  
- 👃 Loss of smell  
- 🚨 Sudden muscle freezing → can lead to **falls and injuries**

> In India alone, **7 million+** older adults suffer from PD — with numbers rapidly rising. Tackling this issue requires **affordable**, **accessible**, and **user-friendly solutions**.

## 🌟 Key Features

🔹 **Non-invasive & Drug-free** — No pills, no side effects  
🔹 **Vibrotactile Therapy** — Gentle, patterned vibrations to calm tremors  
🔹 **Flexible & Wearable** — Lightweight, skin-friendly band for daily use  
🔹 **Semi-automatic** — One-time calibration, then works independently  
🔹 **IoT-Enabled** — Optional remote data logging and monitoring  
🔹 **Affordable** — 🔟× cheaper than traditional treatment options

## 🚨 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Parkinson's Disease is a 🧬 **progressive neurological disorder** affecting mostly older adults (60+).

<details>
<summary><b>📊 GLOBAL IMPACT (Click to expand)</b></summary>

- 📈 **Prevalence doubled** in last 25 years  
- 👥 **8.5 million+** affected globally (2019)  
- 😔 **5.8 million DALYs** due to PD  
- 🧬 15% genetically inherited; others triggered by 🧪 toxins/heavy metals  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🩺 COMMON SYMPTOMS (Click to expand)</b></summary>

- 🤲 Limb & jaw tremors  
- 🪵 Muscle rigidity  
- 🐢 Slowed movement  
- ⚖️ Balance loss  
- 👃 Smell impairment  
- ❗ Sudden freezing → 🤕 falls & accidents  

</details>

> 🧓 In India alone, over **7 million seniors** are living with PD.  
We need 💸 **affordable**, 🧏‍♂️ **accessible**, and 🧰 **easy-to-use** solutions — **now**.

## 🚀 OUR SOLUTION — 💡 TREMOR TECH

A **smart wearable band** that detects tremors in real-time using:
- 📊 **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)**
- ⚡ **EMG (Electromyography) sensors**

🔁 It responds with **vibrotactile stimulation** to disrupt abnormal neuronal activity — reducing tremors and restoring motion. 🧘‍♀️🦾

---

## 🌟 KEY FEATURES

- 🛡️ **Non-invasive & Drug-free** — no side effects!  
- 🔊 **Vibrotactile Therapy** — customized vibrations to calm tremors  
- 🩹 **Flexible & Wearable** — soft, skin-friendly band  
- 🧠 **Semi-automatic** — easy one-time calibration  
- ☁️ **IoT-Enabled** — optional data sync for doctors & caregivers  
- 💸 **Affordable** — **10× cheaper** than current treatments!

## 💎 WHAT MAKES TREMOR TECH UNIQUE?

🎯 **TARGETED NEUROMODULATION** — Stops freezing & early-stage tremors  
💰 **BUDGET-FRIENDLY** — A practical choice for everyday users  
🛡️ **SAFE ALTERNATIVE** — Zero meds, zero risks, zero dependency  
🧠 **CLINICALLY INSPIRED** — Designed to meet real-world needs

---

## 🔬 HOW IT WORKS

1. 🧪 **Sensors** detect abnormal tremor signals (GSR + EMG)  
2. 🧠 **Microcontroller** interprets & analyzes data  
3. 🔊 **Vibration motor** delivers targeted therapy  
4. 🧘‍♂️ **Result:** Smoother movement, better control, more freedom

#  🤖✨ Tremor Tech — Smart Wearable for Parkinson's Tremor Relief 🧠💪

> **💡 Empowering Independence, Restoring Motion.**  
Tremor Tech is an innovative 🛡️ **non-invasive wearable** designed to manage **Parkinson’s Disease (PD)** symptoms like 🌀 tremors and 💢 muscle stiffness — using 🌀 **vibrotactile therapy** and 🧠 **real-time neural response detection**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Parkinson's Disease is a 🧬 **progressive neurological disorder** affecting mostly older adults (60+).

**🌍 Global Impact**
- 📈 Prevalence **doubled** in the last 25 years  
- 👥 **8.5 million+** affected globally (2019)  
- 😔 **5.8 million DALYs** due to PD  
- 🧬 15% genetically inherited; others triggered by 🧪 toxins/heavy metals  

**🩺 Common Symptoms**
- 🤲 Limb & jaw tremors  
- 🪵 Muscle rigidity  
- 🐢 Slowed movement  
- ⚖️ Balance loss  
- 👃 Smell impairment  
- ❗ Sudden freezing → 🤕 falls & accidents  

> 🧓 In India alone, over **7 million seniors** are living with PD.  
We need 💸 **affordable**, 🧏‍♂️ **accessible**, and 🧰 **easy-to-use** solutions — **now**.

## 🚀 Solution — Tremor Tech

A **smart wearable band** that detects tremors in real-time using:
- 📊 **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)**
- ⚡ **EMG (Electromyography) sensors**

🔁 It responds with **vibrotactile stimulation** to disrupt abnormal neuronal activity — reducing tremors and restoring motion. 🧘‍♀️🦾

✅ 🔊 Vibrotactile therapy — customized vibrations to calm tremors  
✅ 🩹 Flexible & wearable — skin-friendly band  
✅ 🧠 Semi-automatic — easy one-time calibration  
✅ ☁️ IoT-enabled — optional data sync for doctors & caregivers  
✅ 💸 Affordable — **10× cheaper** than current treatments  

---

## 💎 Unique Selling Points

- 🎯 **Targeted Neuromodulation** — stops freezing & early-stage tremors  
- 💰 **Budget-friendly** — practical for everyday users  
- 🛡️ **Safe Alternative** — zero meds, zero risks  
- 🧠 **Clinically Inspired** — meets real-world needs  

---

## 🔬 How It Works

1. 🧪 **Sensors** detect abnormal tremor signals (GSR + EMG)  
2. 🧠 **Microcontroller** interprets & analyzes data  
3. 🔊 **Vibration motor** delivers targeted therapy  
4. 🧘 **Result:** smoother movement, better control, more freedom

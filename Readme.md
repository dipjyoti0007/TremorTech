#  Tremor Tech — Smart Wearable for Parkinson's Tremor Relief 

Tremor Tech is an innovative  **non-invasive wearable** designed to manage **Parkinson’s Disease (PD)** symptoms like  tremors and  muscle stiffness — using  **vibrotactile therapy** and  **real-time neural response detection**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Parkinson's Disease is a  **progressive neurological disorder** affecting mostly older adults (60+).

**🌍 Global Impact**
-  Prevalence **doubled** in the last 25 years  
-  **8.5 million+** affected globally (2019)  
-  **5.8 million DALYs** due to PD  
-  15% genetically inherited; others triggered by toxins/heavy metals  

**🩺 Common Symptoms**
- Limb & jaw tremors  
- Muscle rigidity  
- Slowed movement  
- Balance loss  
- Smell impairment  
- ❗Sudden freezing → falls & accidents  

> In India alone, over **7 million seniors** are living with PD.  
We need  **affordable**,  **accessible**, and  **easy-to-use** solutions — **now**.

## 🚀 Solution — Tremor Tech

A **smart wearable band** that detects tremors in real-time using:
-  **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)**
-  **EMG (Electromyography) sensors**

 It responds with **vibrotactile stimulation** to disrupt abnormal neuronal activity — reducing tremors and restoring motion.

## 🌟 Key Features

Non-invasive & drug-free — no side effects  
Vibrotactile therapy — customized vibrations to calm tremors   
Flexible & wearable — skin-friendly band  
Semi-automatic — easy one-time calibration  
IoT-enabled — optional data sync for doctors & caregivers  
Affordable — **10× cheaper** than current treatments  

---

##  Unique Selling Points

-  **Targeted Neuromodulation** — stops freezing & early-stage tremors  
-  **Budget-friendly** — practical for everyday users  
-  **Safe Alternative** — zero meds, zero risks  
-  **Clinically Inspired** — meets real-world needs  

---

## 🔬 How It Works

1.  **Sensors** detect abnormal tremor signals (GSR + EMG)  
2.  **Microcontroller** interprets & analyzes data  
3.  **Vibration motor** delivers targeted therapy  
4.  **Result:** smoother movement, better control, more freedom
